          <p>Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, and
            philosopher who famously conceptualized the Turing Machine and
            contributed to the cryptanalysis of Nazi ciphers in World War
            II.</p>

        <div id="details">
          <p>Born on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, Alan Turing was the
              younger of the two sons of Julius Mathison Turing and Ethel Sara
              Turing.</p>

                alt="Alan Turing at Sherborne School" />
            <p>During his time in school, he was very interested in the studies
                of mathematics and science, and it was at Sherborne School that
                he met Christopher Morcom, someone else who shared his love on
                the topics. After the death of Morcom, their relationship
                inspired Turing to put even more time and energy into his
                work.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Later, in university, Turing published papers about what we now
              know as Turing machines, and how they could perform any algorithm
              so long as they were computable.</p>

                alt="Bombe used to decipher the Enigma" />
            <p>As World War II broke out, Turing became a leading participant of
                breaking the German cipher, and in particular, the Enigma. He
                improved on the Polish machine <i>bomba</i> and his method
                of using statistical techniques to rule out certain settings of
                the Enigma machine has been said to have contributed to
                ending the war two years earlier, and saving more than 14
                million lives.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Turing's work cannot be understated, and his research and ideas
              have lead to advancements such as the modern computer, and better
              approaches in the field of cryptanalysis. It is safe to say that
              without Turing, modern computing would likely not be the way it
              is today.</p>
